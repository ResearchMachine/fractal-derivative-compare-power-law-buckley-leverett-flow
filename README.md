### I. Motivation and Problem
To take into account the heterogeneity of a porous medium, the ideas of fractals are used. The paper compares two approaches to taking into account the fractality of the medium in one hydrodynamic model.

### III. Key Results 
* Implemented the algorithm for constructing a mass function from the article https://arxiv.org/abs/0906.0676 (Calculus on Fractal Curves in R^n);  
* A new model of Buckley-Leverett in fractal media has been developed and the mathematical consistency of the model has been shown;  
* A comparative analysis was carried out with a computationally simpler generalization method, a case is shown when this can be done.
